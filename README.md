# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Evaluate six machine learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk.
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the use of different models of machine learning to see which of these models would be best suited, if any, to predict credit risk. These models include, the RandomOverSamper, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEEN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
## Results
Below is the following results of the models used:

### RandomOverSampler

## Summary
In summary, out of all the machine learning models. I would not use the RandomOverSampler, SMOTE or ClusterCentroids. All three of these models donâ€™t give an accurate analysis of whether there is a credit risk. Looking at the f1 score, we can see that these models are too varied between high-risk and low-risk data. For that same reason, I would not use SMOTEEN either. All four of these models also have a low accuracy score. Although, the accuracy score is higher for the BalancedRandomForestClassifer I would not use this model either because it is also to varied between high-risk and low-risk. If we were required to use one of these six models. I would choose the EasyEnsembleClassifier, mostly as the first step into a deeper analysis. In this model the accuracy score is higher (93.1%), and we can see the differences between high-risk and low-risk creditors are coming closer together.
